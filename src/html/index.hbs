                    Visit 1: We hit this pool with a chemical treatment to clear up as much of the algae as possibly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Visit 2: Leaving the pump of for 48 hours, we returned with a test kit and some hard work ahead of us. We applied a shock
                    treatment to boost up the pool levels to where we need them to be, and also applied a little bit of elbow
                    grease to the bottom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Visit 3: Now we can see some results, but we aren't finished yet. With the shock treatment applied we are now able to adjust
                    our chemical levels and so they can sit nice and pretty and do what they do best
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Visit 4: which leads us to our finally visit. The TLC visit, we gave this pool a bit of love after it had been scrubbed and
                    dose for the past 5 days, we gave it a nice vacuum and a final test and now it's gone from a bummer to
                    summer.

                    This customers pool was constantly going green. Even with constant treatments the algae kept re-appearing. A phone call to
                    the Chris'tal Clear team and we were able to narrow the problem down to a filtration fault. We were also
                    met with the pool having some sever staining. We allowed for 2 chemical treatments over the course of
                    a week and the results speak for themselves.

                    Are you also met with this problem?
